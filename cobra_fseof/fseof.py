    """Runs the FSEOF algorithm [1].

    Args:
        model: the metabolic model on which to run FSEOF.
        num_steps: the number of steps to interpolate between the initial
            and highest enforced fluxes.
        enforced: the enforced (e.g., product) reaction.
        objective: the base objective (e.g., biomass) reaction.
        enforced_direction: the direction in which FSEOF
            optimizes the enforced reaction.
        enforced_frac_opt: the fraction of the theoretical optimal enforced flux
            to use as the upper interpolation boundary.
        reactions: the space of reactions that FSEOF considers when searching for
            targets. If None, this is set to all reactions in the input model.
        optimizer: the FBA optimizer that is used. If None, this is set to
            the regular COBRApy optimizer.

    Returns:
        An named tuple, FSEOFResults, of pandas DataFrames whose fields are:
        - step: Each row summarizes an interpolation step during FSEOF.
            The index is the step ID and the enforced and objective fluxes are
            stored as columns.
        - scan: Each row corresponds to the flux data of a reaction during FSOEF.
            The index is the reaction ID and the columns are: "target"
            (a boolean for whether the reaction is considered a target),
            "vmin" and "vmax" from the FSEOF algorithm, and "flux<i>" (the
            flux of the reaction in the i-th interpolation step).
        - fva: After FSEOF, Choi et al. [1] use FVA to further refine the
            targets. Each row summarizes the FVA data of a target reaction
            identified in the scan DataFrame. The index is the reaction ID
            and the columns are: "rank" (the score of the target, higher meaning
            better), and "min<i>" and "max<i>" (the flux bounds of the reaction
            identified by FVA in the i-th interpolation step).
